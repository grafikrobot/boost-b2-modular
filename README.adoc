= Modular Boost w/B2

This is a work-in-progress version of the Boost {CPP} Libraries that build as
modular components. What does it mean to be modular? It means that..

. Each library is separable from the rest.
. Each library does not assume a particular directory arrangement in a parent
  Boost super-project.
. The Boost super-project doesn't need to exist at all, only requirement is that
  library dependencies be pre-declared.
