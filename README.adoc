= Modular Boost w/B2

This is a work-in-progress version of the Boost {CPP} Libraries that build as
modular components. What does it mean to be modular? It means that..

* Each library is separable from the rest.
* Each library does not assume a particular directory arrangement in a parent
  Boost super-project.
* The Boost super-project doesn't need to exist at all, only requirement is that
  library dependencies be pre-declared.
* No no need for creating the headers tree.
* Makes it possible for package managers, and hence users, to use the individual
  libraries they need.

== Goals

This repository is a moving goal for the transition of Boost to a modular build.
It is one end of the goal posts for such a transition. The idea is that this
repo will incrementally work it's way toward becoming identical to the main
Boost repo (https://github.com/boostorg/boost) and related sub-repos. While at
the same time the main Boost repo will work towards changing to become this
repo. Meeting at some point in the middle when both are equivalent.

== Structure

Like the main Boost repo, it is composed of many git submodules for all the
libraries, tools, and support code. But there is one key difference: the
submodules are not branched from the originals. Instead all the submodules are
patched, and subsequently edited, and new patches generated, and repeating that
cycle. All the patching scripts, extra files, and patches are in the patch
directory. When the time comes that the this and the main Boost repos are
equivalent it's expected that all the patch files here will be empty.

To try out the patched version of this Boost tree you first need an installed
B2 (see https://www.bfgroup.xyz/b2/manual/release/index.html#bbv2.installation
for install instructions). Note that this requires the use of the most recent
in progress release branch. As there are continuing fixes, and adjustments, to
B2 to facilitate this effort. Currently you need to `git clone` the
`version/4.9.5` branch. Or download a ZIP snapshot
(https://github.com/bfgroup/b2/archive/refs/heads/version/4.9.5.zip).

After that you only need to clone this repo and run the patch procedure:

[source,shell]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/grafikrobot/boost-b2-modular.git
cd boost-b2-modular
./patch/patch-apply.sh
----

== Making Changes

While I, Ren√©, am making all the changes to make this conversion happen
(by hand) I will not turn away others from wanting to contribute. Assuming
you have the repo cloned there are a couple of scripts to run that
automate some of the work.

Instead of running the `patch/patch-apply.sh` script one should use the
`patch/patch-update.sh` script that updates all the library submodules to their
latest `develop` state and subsequently applies the patches. The script takes
care of resetting to a clean state before the update and patching.

NOTE: A possible effect of the patching is for it to fail to apply if there
are conflicts. You will need to resolve those, if you can. Or wait for me to
do so.

After you do changes to a library, or other, submodule you can run the
`patch/patch-gen.sh` script to generate new patch file(s). It's those patch
files that you can contribute back here.

There might be new files that need to get added, or old one deleted, also.
For those you can add the new files in the `patch/libs/<lib>/` directories
and add appropriate symbolic link commands in the `patch/patch-apply.sh` script.
There are also commands in that script to delete any files that should no longer
exist.
